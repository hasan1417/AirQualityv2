# Air Quality Index (AQI) Forecasting System

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive air quality forecasting system using advanced machine learning techniques. The system analyzes historical AQI data from multiple cities worldwide and provides accurate 7-day forecasts using ensemble learning approaches.

## Problem Statement

Air quality forecasting is critical for public health, environmental planning, and policy-making. Traditional statistical methods often fail to capture the complex, non-linear relationships between various environmental factors and air quality. This project addresses these challenges by:

- **Data Complexity**: Handling multi-city, multi-pollutant datasets with missing values and temporal dependencies
- **Forecasting Accuracy**: Implementing ensemble machine learning models that outperform traditional time series methods
- **Scalability**: Processing large datasets (100K+ samples) efficiently while maintaining prediction quality
- **Real-world Applicability**: Providing actionable insights for air quality management across different geographical regions

## Technical Approach

### Data Engineering
- **Multi-city Integration**: Combines data from 6 major cities (New York, London, Dubai, Sydney, Cairo, Brasilia)
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates temporal features including lag variables (1, 2, 3, 7 days) and rolling statistics (mean, std, min, max)
- **Temporal Splitting**: Implements proper time series validation to prevent data leakage

### Machine Learning Architecture
The system employs three state-of-the-art ensemble learning algorithms:

1. **Random Forest Regressor**
   - Hyperparameter optimization via GridSearchCV
   - Handles non-linear relationships and feature interactions
   - Robust to outliers and overfitting

2. **LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)**
   - Gradient boosting with early stopping
   - Optimized for large datasets and memory efficiency
   - Handles categorical features and missing values

3. **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)**
   - Advanced gradient boosting with regularization
   - Built-in cross-validation and early stopping
   - Excellent performance on structured data

### Model Selection Strategy
- **Performance Metrics**: MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and RÂ² scores
- **Temporal Validation**: Ensures models generalize to future time periods
- **Ensemble Ranking**: Automatic selection of best-performing model for deployment

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- 8GB+ RAM recommended for large dataset processing
- Internet connection for initial package installation

### Quick Start
1. **Clone or download** the project files
2. **Navigate** to the project directory: `cd AirQualityv2`
3. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Run the complete analysis**: `python run_analysis.py`

## Usage

### Single Command Execution
The entire analysis pipeline can be executed with one command:

```bash
python run_analysis.py
```

This command will:
1. Load and preprocess air quality data from multiple cities
2. Engineer temporal features for time series forecasting
3. Train three machine learning models with hyperparameter optimization
4. Compare model performance across multiple metrics
5. Generate comprehensive visualizations and reports
6. Export the best-performing model for future use
7. Save all results to organized output directories

### Expected Output
After successful execution, you'll find:
- **Performance Comparison**: Model rankings and metrics
- **Visualizations**: 
  - Performance comparison charts (MAE, RMSE, MAPE, RÂ²)
  - Predicted vs actual scatter plots for each model
  - **Test dataset predictions vs actual** - Separate subplots for each model showing the validation period
  - **Clear sample indexing** - X-axis shows test sample indices representing different environmental conditions
- **Exported Model**: Best model configuration and parameters (JSON format)
- **Results**: CSV files with predictions and analysis reports

## Results and Performance

### Model Performance Summary
Based on extensive testing with 105,408 samples across 6 cities:

| Model | MAE | RMSE | MAPE | RÂ² Score | Rank |

   - Rolling statistics: Moving averages and volatility measures
   - Temporal encoding: Day-of-week and seasonal patterns
4. **Validation Strategy**: Temporal train-test split preserving time order
5. **Data Representation**:
